# three_agent_simulator
A simulation of omnivores, herbivores, and herbs on a macroscopic scale. A three agent antagonistic automata!

How to play:
1. Download requirements, see requirements.txt
2. Run Main file
3. Controls: Using your mouse, left-click creates grass, right-click creates herbivores, pressing A creates omnviores, press space to start, and press Q to kill the program.
4. The simulation shows the movements of green herbs, yellow herbivores, and teal (bluish) omnivores. Once finished matplotlib graphs will show data of the simulation
Due to the default setting, which can be changed, place at least 3 squares of each kind next to each other.

The code can easily be used to simulate yearly pesticides, different behaviors of the pests, omnivores, and grass. Made because I found it cool, but it is generally quite insightful to look at. 

Analysis.pdf is an analysis of the simulation. Scroll through it for some summaries on macroscopic three-agent patterns.

Examples starting with 3 main clusters (in graphs carnivores are called pests):

On a macroscale, a showcase of that pesticides on herbs kill the apex predators in an ecosystem due to their much lower reproductive rate that the actual herbs (in graphs carnivores are called pests).

Which is true in real life, so I am quite proud of this simulation!
