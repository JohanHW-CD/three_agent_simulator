# three_agent_simulator
A simulation of omnivores, herbivores, and herbs on a macroscopic scale. A three agent antagonistic automata!

How to run:
1. Run the code
2. Place agents by hovering the mouse over a square, left-click gives grass, right-click gives herbivores, A gives omnviores
3. Due to the default setting, which can be changed, place at least 3 squares of each kind next to each other.
4. Press S to start, press Q to kill. number_of_sims is how many times it should run. number_of_steps is how many time-steps it should take.
5. Once finished a graph like the following is produced.

The code allows you to throw in yearly pesticides, different behaviors of the pests, omnivores, and grass as well as analyze it. Intended for my own use but it's neat.
